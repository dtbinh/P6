- To make the simulations up and running it is first necessary to install V-REP and MATLAB.

- After installing V-REP go to ...\V-REP3\V-REP_PRO_EDU\programming\remoteApiBindings\matlab\matlab and follow the readMe to install the API files.

- To run the basic simulation. Open the "LoadBalancing_ReinforcementLearning_Final" simulation and the matlab file called "RL_Brain". 
  Run the simulation first and then run the "RL_Brain".

- To run the RL simulation. Open the "LoadBalancing_ReinforcementLearning_Final" simulation and the matlab file called "RL_Brain".
  Open a new matlab program and open the file called "C_Robot_RL_With_Count_V7". 
  Run the simulation first, then the "RL_Brain" and lastly "C_Robot_RL_With_Count_V7". 

- To run the RL simulation with two robots. Disable the script for the middle robot in the simulation and do the same as stated above, 
  but instead of running "C_Robot_RL_With_Count_V7" run "C_Robot_RL_With_Count_V7_Two_Robots".
